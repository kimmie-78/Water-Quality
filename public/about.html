        <h1>About Us - Understanding Water Quality</h1>
        <p>
            Water quality is essential for human health, agriculture, and the environment. Ensuring that the water we drink and use is free of harmful contaminants is crucial for our well-being. In this page, we'll explain the most common contaminants found in water and methods to ensure water is safe to use and drink.

            <h2>Common Contaminants in Water</h2>

            <h3>1. Aluminium</h3>
            <p>
                Aluminium is a naturally occurring element, but high levels can enter water sources from industrial waste. Prolonged exposure to aluminium in drinking water can affect kidney function.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Arsenic</h3>
            <p>
                Arsenic is a toxic element that can contaminate water through natural deposits or industrial pollution. Long-term exposure to arsenic can cause serious health problems, including cancer.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Ammonia</h3>
            <p>
                Ammonia can be found in drinking water due to agricultural runoff, industrial waste, or the breakdown of organic matter. It can be toxic in high concentrations, affecting the respiratory system.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Barium</h3>
            <p>
                Barium is a naturally occurring mineral that can seep into groundwater from drilling activities. High levels of barium can lead to cardiovascular and kidney problems.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Fix Water Contamination</h2>
            <p>
                Fortunately, several methods can help remove harmful contaminants from water and ensure its safety for drinking and other uses. Below are common treatment techniques for each contaminant:
            </p>

            <div class="fix-method">
                <h3>1. Removing Aluminium</h3>
                <p>
                    Aluminium can be removed through chemical coagulation, where the contaminant binds to chemicals added to water, forming larger particles that can be filtered out.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="fix-method">
                <h3>2. Treating Arsenic Contamination</h3>
                <p>
                    Arsenic can be effectively removed using reverse osmosis, ion exchange, or activated alumina. These processes filter out the arsenic particles and make water safe to drink.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="fix-method">
                <h3>3. Eliminating Ammonia</h3>
                <p>
                    Ammonia can be treated through biological filtration or chlorination. These processes neutralize or break down ammonia into safer compounds.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="fix-method">
                <h3>4. Reducing Barium Levels</h3>
                <p>
                    Barium can be reduced by ion exchange and reverse osmosis. These methods are highly effective at filtering out harmful barium from drinking water.
